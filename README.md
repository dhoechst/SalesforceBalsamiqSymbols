Salesforce Balsamiq Symbols
===========================

Symbols for use in Balsamiq that represent common Salesforce components.

To use in a project, add project components to an assets folder in the same directory as the Balsamiq project. See [Working with Symbols](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110439-working-with-symbols) for an example.

Basic instructions to use in Balsamiq:

1. Create a new mockup in Balsamiq.
2. Save mockup.
3. Download this project as a zip file, extract, and rename the parent folder to "assets"
4. Copy the assets folder to the same location as your new mockup.
5. You should see the symbols show up in the Project Assets tab.
